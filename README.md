## API üñ•Ô∏è
Free and robust API: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3

### API Key üîë
You must provide a developer key to fetch the data from TMDB API.
* Generate a new key (v3 auth) from [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
* Create a new kotlin file `ApiKey.kt` in path `./buildSrc/src/main/java/`.
* Define a constant `TMDB_API_KEY` with the double quotes, it looks like

```kotlin
object ApiKey {
    const val TMDB_API_KEY = "\"5f422***********************8db5\""
}
```

> **NOTE**: If you're missing the double quotes, it will build fail.
